# MRQ-Song
This program is created with the help of graphics and sound in CPP. It composes the song "Mere Rashke Qamar" using these functions.

This is just a little try of composing a song with the help of a program in CPP. It uses various ups and downs of frequencies and delays to get similarity with the original song.

- It uses graphics.h and sound.h libraries so please check if you have these installed.
- Using TurboC++/ MSDOS is recommended.
- IT sounds more like the old video games ;)
- ENJOY
